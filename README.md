# Horiseon Homepage

## Description 

I was asked by the client to update their homepage to reflect a codebase that follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines. I did this by updating descriptive titles, adding sequential headings, accessible alt attributes, as well as logical and semantic html elements.

Site has not yet been deployed by the customer.
